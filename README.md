# face_recognition
A high-performance, real-time multi-person face recognition system built with Python. Optimized with 0.25x frame scaling for max FPS, it features robust 128D mean embedding profiles (20-sample averaging) and a custom "Nose-Track" liveness detection algorithm to prevent photo spoofing. Clean, modular architecture released under the Unlicense.
