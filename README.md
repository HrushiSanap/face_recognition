\# Smart Face Recognition System with Liveness Detection

A robust, modular, and privacy-focused face recognition system built with Python, OpenCV, and Dlib. This project goes beyond simple matching by implementing **\*\*Smart Liveness Detection\*\*** (Blink \+ Head Movement tracking) to prevent photo spoofing attacks.

\#\# 🔭 About the Project

This system is designed to identify users in real-time while ensuring they are physically present. Unlike standard face recognition scripts that can be tricked by holding up a photo, this system requires active verification via **\*\*facial gestures\*\***.

It uses a modular architecture where the core logic is separated from the execution scripts, making it scalable and easy to maintain.

## **✨ Key Features**

### **1\. Modular Architecture**

Code is organized into a src package. Logic, configuration, and execution are decoupled, making the codebase clean and professional.

### **2\. Multi-Factor Liveness Detection**

To mark a user as "Live" (Green Box), they must perform **one** of the following actions:

* **Blink:** Detected via Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR).  
* **Head Movement:** Detected by tracking the Euclidean distance of the nose tip vector across frames.

### **3\. Floating UI Design**

Instead of obstructive solid boxes, the system uses a modern "floating text" design with high-contrast outlines (strokes), ensuring readability on both dark and light backgrounds.

### **4\. Smart State Latching**

Once a liveness action (Blink/Move) is detected, the system "remembers" the live status for a configurable duration (default: 2 seconds). This prevents the UI from flickering between "Live" and "Spoof" while the user is interacting normally.

**🧠 Technical Logic: How It Works**

### **A. Face Encoding**

We use the **HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients)** model via dlib to detect faces. The face is then transformed into a **128-dimensional vector** (embedding). When identifying a user, we calculate the Euclidean distance between the live face vector and our known database.

### **B. Blink Detection (EAR)**

We map 6 landmarks per eye. The Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) is calculated using the formula:

$$EAR \= \\frac{||p2 \- p6|| \+ ||p3 \- p5||}{2 \\times ||p1 \- p4||}$$

* If the EAR falls below 0.24 (eyes closed) for 2 consecutive frames, a blink is registered.

### **C. Movement Detection (Nose Tracking)**

We track the **Nose Tip** landmark (Index 30 in the 68-point model).

* The system calculates the Euclidean distance of the nose tip between the current frame and the previous frame.  
* If the distance \> 2.5 pixels, it registers as intentional movement (nodding/turning).

**🚀 Installation & Setup**

### **1\. Clone the Repository**

Bash

git clone \[https://github.com/HrushiSanap/face\_recognition.git\](https://github.com/HrushiSanap/face\_recognition.git)  
cd face\_recognition

### **2\. Install Dependencies**

**Note:** This project requires dlib, which compiles C++ code. You may need CMake installed (pip install cmake).

Bash

pip install \-r requirements.txt

*If you face errors installing dlib on Windows, install [Visual Studio C++ Build Tools](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/) first.*

## ---

**🛠 Usage Guide**

All commands are run using the central main.py controller located inside the face\_recognition\_system folder.

**First, navigate to the code folder:**

Bash

cd face\_recognition\_system

### **Step 1: Capture User Data**

This will open your webcam. Look at the camera and slowly rotate your head to capture different angles.

Bash

python main.py capture \--name "YourName"

* **Controls:** Press q to quit early.  
* **Output:** Images are saved in data/raw/YourName/.

### **Step 2: Train the Model**

This processes the images and creates the facial embeddings.

Bash

python main.py train

* **Output:** Creates data/models/encodings.pickle.

### **Step 3: Start Recognition**

Run the main security system.

Bash

python main.py run

* **Visual Indicators:**  
  * 🔴 **Red:** Unknown Face.  
  * 🟡 **Yellow/Cyan:** Known Face, but static (Potential Spoof).  
  * 🟢 **Green:** Known Face \+ Live (Blink/Move verified).  
* **Controls:** Press q to exit.

**⚙️ Configuration**

You can fine-tune the system sensitivities in src/config.py.

| Parameter | Default | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| EYE\_AR\_THRESH | 0.24 | Threshold for "eyes closed". Lower if it detects blinks too easily. |
| EYE\_AR\_CONSEC\_FRAMES | 2 | How many frames eyes must be closed to count as a blink. |
| MOVEMENT\_THRESHOLD | 2.5 | Minimum pixel distance nose must move to trigger "Live". |
| LIVENESS\_TIMEOUT | 2.0 | Seconds the "Live" status persists after a gesture. |
| RECOGNITION\_INTERVAL | 5 | Runs heavy face recognition every N frames to save CPU. |

**❓ Troubleshooting**

**1\. ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'src'**

* Ensure you are running the command from *inside* the face\_recognition\_system directory, not the root repo folder.

**2\. dlib installation fails**

* Windows: Install "Desktop development with C++" workload via Visual Studio Build Tools.  
* Linux: Run sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake.

**3\. System is lagging**

* Open src/config.py and increase FRAME\_RESIZE\_SCALE (e.g., make it smaller, like 0.20) or increase RECOGNITION\_INTERVAL to 10\.
